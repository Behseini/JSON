JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.

Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/values pairs:

{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}

JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.

Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain multiple objects:

"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
In the example above, the object "employees" is an array containing three objects. Each object is a record of a person (with a first name and a last name).

JSON Uses JavaScript Syntax
Because JSON uses JavaScript syntax, no extra software is needed to work with JSON within JavaScript.

With JavaScript you can create an array of objects and assign data to it like this:

Example

var employees = [
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName": "Jones"}
];
The first entry in the JavaScript object array can be accessed like this:

employees[0].firstName + " " + employees[0].lastName;
The returned content will be:

John Doe
The data can be modified like this:

employees[0].firstName = "Gilbert";





<?php
$arr = array('a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3, 'd' => 4, 'e' => 5);

echo json_encode($arr);
?>

The above example will output:

{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5}
a
